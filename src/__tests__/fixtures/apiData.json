      "raw_description": "For the last 20 years the \"Hello GoodBye Show\" has proven itself a pillar of the anti-establishment, offering a consistent and supportive platform for quite literally thousands of left-field and counter-cultural artists, and while some were near household names (Ari Up / Pete Seeger), and others would go on to achieve wide acclaim (Sleaford Mods / This Is The Kit), the vast majority of live guests would continue to gleefully plough their own idiosyncratic furrows, with never an inkling to pander to, nor placate any pre-conceived idea of mainstream ideal.\n\nIt feels fully holistic to collaborate with Upset The Rhythm for HG20, a triptych of consecutive concerts held in celebration of The Hello GoodBye Show’s 20th birthday, as Chris Tipton from UTR himself first appeared as a guest on HG back in 2007 with the boisterous brevity biased band Hands On Heads and later again with the psycho-geographically prone duo Way Through.\n\nAll profits made from HG20 will go directly towards helping Resonance FM return to live programming as soon as possible. \n\nThis series of Resonance FM fundraisers will take place in the atmospheric and intimate location of The Memorable Order Of Tin Hats Club (M.O.T.H. Club) over three consecutive nights; Saturday 30th July, Sunday 31st July & Monday 1st August.\n\nThe deXter Bentley Hello GoodBye Show originally began broadcasting back in May 2002, as part of a small team of autonomous program makers, creating freewheeling and innovative new content for the advent of the avant-garde, arts radio station Resonance FM, the first community based, not-for-profit, arts radio station in London.\n\nThe genesis of Resonance FM can be traced to John Peel’s Meltdown in 1998, when the LMC (London Musician’s Collective) were invited to broadcast an experimental radio station over the course of the festival on a localised bandwidth from The Southbank Centre on The River Thames. \n\nIn 2002 Resonance FM was awarded the licence to broadcast over the 104.4 FM wavelength in Central London, and over the following five years (2002-2007) it was situated in the heart of Tin-Pan-Alley on Denmark Street. Over the past 14 years Resonance FM has been based on Borough High Street but during the pandemic it has been forced to relocate once again and is currently painstakingly repurposing an old abandoned chapel in SE1.\n\ndeXter Bentley continues to aspire to the two worded mantra/manifesto that was originally bestowed upon him by Resonance FM Station Manager Ed Baxter, who said, ‘BE BOLD!’.",

He was given the name to hide behind. After a while he realized he was stuck with it. Onstage he hides behind nothing, he tells the truth with big open chords, lilting enchantment, squalls of feedback, dissonance, bizarre stories and backchat. Eric began his recording life on Stiff Records in 1977 with his enduring hit Whole Wide World when he was little more than an ex-teenage art student. Eventually he sidestepped the mechanics of stardom to become Britain’s biggest underground household name, much loved and often underestimated. His 2015 album ‘amERICa’ reminded those who’ve kept the faith and new generations of fans what he’s all about. He won’t recreate 1978 for you, he’ll blow your mind instead.\\nhttps://wrecklesseric.com/\n\nMEATRAFFLE is a common chord running through the leftist brigades of the South London art scene. For Meatraffle it is the political, the platonic, the comradeship of the struggle that provides true artistic grist.\n\nLILITH AI is a guitarist, who writes and performs poignant tales of modern life. Hailing from nowhere special, Lilith began releasing lo-fi bedroom recordings in 2016. Her first EP RIOT is full of underground anthems popular with Riot grrrls word wide. Her second EP Native Tongue chronicles her teen years, spent living on the streets of Queens New York. 2019 saw the release of 3rd EP Bare Radical with evolving sounds.  Lilith's artfully delivered songs fit somewhere between indie pop and anti-folk.\n\n",

      "description": "For the last 20 years the \"Hello GoodBye Show\" has proven itself a pillar of the anti-establishment, offering a consistent and supportive platform for quite literally thousands of left-field and counter-cultural artists, and while some were near household names (Ari Up / Pete Seeger), and others would go on to achieve wide acclaim (Sleaford Mods / This Is The Kit), the vast majority of live guests would continue to gleefully plough their own idiosyncratic furrows, with never an inkling to pander to, nor placate any pre-conceived idea of mainstream ideal.\n\nIt feels fully holistic to collaborate with Upset The Rhythm for HG20, a triptych of consecutive concerts held in celebration of The Hello GoodBye Show’s 20th birthday, as Chris Tipton from UTR himself first appeared as a guest on HG back in 2007 with the boisterous brevity biased band Hands On Heads and later again with the psycho-geographically prone duo Way Through.\n\nAll profits made from HG20 will go directly towards helping Resonance FM return to live programming as soon as possible. \n\nThis series of Resonance FM fundraisers will take place in the atmospheric and intimate location of The Memorable Order Of Tin Hats Club (M.O.T.H. Club) over three consecutive nights; Saturday 30th July, Sunday 31st July & Monday 1st August.\n\nThe deXter Bentley Hello GoodBye Show originally began broadcasting back in May 2002, as part of a small team of autonomous program makers, creating freewheeling and innovative new content for the advent of the avant-garde, arts radio station Resonance FM, the first community based, not-for-profit, arts radio station in London.\n\nThe genesis of Resonance FM can be traced to John Peel’s Meltdown in 1998, when the LMC (London Musician’s Collective) were invited to broadcast an experimental radio station over the course of the festival on a localised bandwidth from The Southbank Centre on The River Thames. \n\nIn 2002 Resonance FM was awarded the licence to broadcast over the 104.4 FM wavelength in Central London, and over the following five years (2002-2007) it was situated in the heart of Tin-Pan-Alley on Denmark Street. Over the past 14 years Resonance FM has been based on Borough High Street but during the pandemic it has been forced to relocate once again and is currently painstakingly repurposing an old abandoned chapel in SE1.\n\ndeXter Bentley continues to aspire to the two worded mantra/manifesto that was originally bestowed upon him by Resonance FM Station Manager Ed Baxter, who said, ‘BE BOLD!’.\n\nWRECKLESS ERIC is Eric Goulden. He was given the name to hide behind. After a while he realized he was stuck with it. Onstage he hides behind nothing, he tells the truth with big open chords, lilting enchantment, squalls of feedback, dissonance, bizarre stories and backchat. Eric began his recording life on Stiff Records in 1977 with his enduring hit Whole Wide World when he was little more than an ex-teenage art student. Eventually he sidestepped the mechanics of stardom to become Britain’s biggest underground household name, much loved and often underestimated. His 2015 album ‘amERICa’ reminded those who’ve kept the faith and new generations of fans what he’s all about. He won’t recreate 1978 for you, he’ll blow your mind instead.\\nhttps://wrecklesseric.com/\n\nMEATRAFFLE is a common chord running through the leftist brigades of the South London art scene. For Meatraffle it is the political, the platonic, the comradeship of the struggle that provides true artistic grist.\n\nLILITH AI is a guitarist, who writes and performs poignant tales of modern life. Hailing from nowhere special, Lilith began releasing lo-fi bedroom recordings in 2016. Her first EP RIOT is full of underground anthems popular with Riot grrrls word wide. Her second EP Native Tongue chronicles her teen years, spent living on the streets of Queens New York. 2019 saw the release of 3rd EP Bare Radical with evolving sounds.  Lilith's artfully delivered songs fit somewhere between indie pop and anti-folk.\n\n\n\nPresented by Upset The Rhythm.\n\nThis is a 18+ event. ",
